My Module 3 Challenge - Python

Thank you for reading this read-me file! 
In my PyBanks and PyPoll folders within this repository you will find the resources used, the text file located in the analysis, and the main script known as "main.py" for each.

References used below to assist with code:
I mainly used class references/material regarding modules with "import," dictionaries, functions, and how to open, write, and read a csv file. 

I used AskBCS for help regarding the greatest increase and decrease of profits. I had trouble debugging the code quite a lot and they helped me and suggested these changes: 
"max_increase_date = dates[max_increase_index]
By replacing months with dates, we ensure that the max_increase_date variable contains the complete date (including the year) corresponding to the greatest increase in profits. "
They also fixed some of my code when it came to defining the variables and any debugging needed for the PyBank code portion of the assignment. 

Another reference used was for the next function, help located within: 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14257373/how-to-skip-the-headers-when-processing-a-csv-file-using-python/14257599#14257599

In reference to the changes and average in profits/losses , I used the help of a peer who asked a question to our instructor on zoom, and he advised us verbally how to best calculate it logically, what methods and processes/steps to do. I reviewed the recording, and tried my best to write code based off of that.

I've also attached screenshots incase it was needed to see the result in the terminals.
